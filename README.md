# Image Gallery

> This image-gallery micro-service contains components for the main image view, a display of extra product images, and many events to interact with these components. The most notable feature of this micro-service is the native implenetation of a zoom feature with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. No external library was utilized to achieve the zoom effect and its accompanying modal components.
